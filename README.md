# 📞 Call Center Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Excel dashboard** built using **Call Center performance data**.  
The dashboard helps track and analyze customer satisfaction, call volume, and representative performance.  

A key feature is the **Representative Slicer** – selecting one of the five representatives instantly updates the entire dashboard to show only that rep’s performance metrics.
